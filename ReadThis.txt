Hello felows :D, 
it's my honor to share this module with you which is 
		a Gateway-Communication Manager 
it offers the follwing features
- highly portable, extendable, and configurable module as needed
- it uses only 4K-Bytes of memory
- can be easly extended and/or ported to to work on any microcontroller,
	and to use any number of communication channels, 
	currently it works with USART, I2C, SPI (CAN-Binding) and at32 and tiva-c
- the user can select the channel or let the gateway do it 
- can handle any numebr of requests with the dynamic-allocation setting
	and a defined number by the user with the static-allocation setting
- two priority levels on data so you define if the data needs to be transmitted 
	in the very next operation or to be queued as a normal operation
- it uses two operating schemes using static and dynamic memory allocation
- it simulates an internal simple-scheduler handling the requests
- 3 simultanuos sending operations

i'll be any opinion and or edit? it will be very appreciated
